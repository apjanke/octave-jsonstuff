# Converts a Texinfo file to a QHelp .qhp index int its generated
# HTML files.
#
# Usage:
#
#   mkqhp.pl <texifile> <outfile>
#
#   <texifile> is the input .texi file
#   <outfile> is the output .qhp file
#
# Maps each node in the Texinfo document to its corresponding node
# HTML file. Builds a QHelp index for them matching that hierarchy.
