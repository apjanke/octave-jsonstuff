@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

This is the manual for the JsonStuff package version @value{VERSION} for GNU Octave.

This document is a work in progress. You are invited to help improve it and
submit patches.

JsonStuff provides JSON encoding and decoding functionality for Octave by supplying
Matlab-compatible implementations for the @code{jsonencode}, @code{jsondecode}, and 
related functions.

JsonStuff was written by Andrew Janke <@email{floss@@apjanke.net}>. Support can be
found on the @url{https://github.com/apjanke/octave-jsonstuff, JsonStuff project
GitHub page}.




@node Getting Started
@chapter Getting Started

The easiest way to obtain JsonStuff is by using Octave's @code{pkg} package manager. To
install the latest development (unstable) head of JsonStuff, run this in Octave:

@example
pkg install https://github.com/apjanke/octave-jsonstuff/archive/master.zip
@end example

Soon, once the code gets a bit more stable, numbered releases for JsonStuff will be
available, and you should use those instead.

For development, you can obtain the source code for JsonStuff from the project repo on GitHub at 
@url{https://github.com/apjanke/octave-jsonstuff}. Upon first installation, run
the @file{octave_jsonstuff_make_local} script to build the octfiles so JsonStuff
will work. Then add the @file{inst} directory in the repo to your Octave path.
