JsonStuff TODO
==============

* Tests
* jsondecode
  * oct file jsoncpp wrapper
* [UBJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBJSON) support
* Other TODOs scattered around the code
* Probably OOP-ify the code (keeping `jsonencode`/`jsondecode`) as front-end function wrappers
  * So I can support various encoding/decoding options
* Maybe octfile-ify jsonencode, for speed
* Maybe support Java objects?
